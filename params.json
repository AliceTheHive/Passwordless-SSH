{"name":"Passwordless-ssh","tagline":"Script to automate creation and configuration of passwordless SSH across computers","body":"This script helps configure passwordless SSH between two machines.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\nThe script itself is nothing more than putting in line the few commands needed to set up this rather simple, if annoying, procedure and should keep\r\nyou focusing on the important stuff rather than remembering syntax details.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nYou must place this script on the client machine and run it. You can provide two arguments on the command line, the first one is the hostname that will\r\naccept passwordless login and the second one is the username on that machine.\r\n\r\nIf the second argument is ommited, the username will default to the username on the client machine and if both arguments are omitted, they will be asked interactively.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
